What?

This is a drum machine written in mostly JavaScript.

It's sorta terrible and wonderful.

Terrible?

Well it's not very accurate. It uses timeouts to keep time, but timeouts aren't very precise, and if you're doing anything while it's playing (and I mean mouse over the window or something) it'll stutter a little. Also, Safari's the only thing that comes close to playing in any kind of rhythm. Chrome makes some noises, but it's clearly not trying very hard. Firefox won't play any of the audio files I throw at it. Sucks on you, Firefox.

Wonderful?
----------

It's a drum machine that runs in your browser! That's kinda rad, isn't it?

Why?
----

It was originally supposed to be an iPad app (you can kinda tell) with PhoneGap. But the audio API in Mobile Safari is kinda broke--intentionally, according to Apple--so I gave up. Maybe I'll go back to that some day. Maybe I'll use PhoneGap's audio API.

Huh.

Yeah.
